### Types

Types define which kind of changes you made to the project.

| Types    | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| feat     | A new feature.                                                                                               |
| fix      | A bug fix.                                                                                                   |

| style    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).      |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.                                                   |
| perf     | A code change that improves performance.                                                                     |

### Scopes

Scopes define what part of the code changed.

### Examples

```sh
git commit -m "feat(users): add POST /users/signup"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation process"
git commit -m "fix(messages): should emit events to connected users"
```

## Directory Structure

```text
├── email
├── public
├── scripts
└── src
    ├── models
    ├── services
    ├── tools
    └── typings
```

### Each folder explained

- `email` : email template(s) and translation(s)
- `src` : all source files
  - `models` : models that represent tables in database
  - `services` : all REST API endpoints
  - `tools` : configs and utilities
  - `typings` : types gloablly used in the project
- `uploads` : uploaded files by users

### Services folder explained with an example

We have API REST services for the `channels`.

Here is what potentially look like a folder structure for this service :

```text
└── src
    └── services
        └── channels
            ├── __docs__
            │   └── get.yaml
            ├── __test__
            │   └── get.test.ts
            ├── :channelId
            │   ├── __docs__
            │   │   ├── delete.yaml
            │   │   └── put.yaml
            │   ├── __test__
            │   │   ├── delete.test.ts
            │   │   └── put.test.ts
            │   ├── delete.ts
            │   ├── index.ts
            │   └── put.ts
            ├── get.ts
            └── index.ts
```

This folder structure will map to these REST API routes :

- GET `/channels`
- DELETE `/channels/:channelId`
- PUT `/channels/:channelId`

The folders after `src/services` : is the real path of the routes in the API except folders starting and ending with `__` like `__docs__`, `__test__` or `__utils__`.

The filenames correspond to the HTTP methods used (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`).
